# Odin-landing-page
- Landing page designed from the odin projects is landing page assignment for learning css. I have made modifications to the design to make things in my style and look. I have changed the color palette and will be using what I learn from this as a basis for my github website update.

# Technology Stack
- HTML & CSS

# Updates & Design Desisions
- I want this to be a basis for my upcoming update to my website and will use my already existing color palette and style to match this.
